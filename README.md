# Meeting Reminder Ball
An annoying but effective meeting reminder that ensures you will never miss a meeting.

---

**Problem:**

1. As a Business Professional I need an effective way to remember when I have an upcoming meeting.
2. Outlook's Meeting reminders are not obtrusive or annoying enough for me to be able to remember I have a meeting.

**Solution:**
1. With the usage of some simple vba scripting and execution of an executable, I can have an annoying ball bounce around the screen any time a Outlook reminder pops up.
